                 Outside of the office, everyone can be comfortable in their casual summertime apparel, so it’s a little less formal. That creates a laid-back atmosphere where employees are more likely to let their guard down, shoot the breeze with one another, and network across the company. It’s one of those corporate event themes that doesn’t end up feeling so corporate.<br>
                
                SETTINGS: A park setting by a lake is the perfect location, plus it’s usually a free or low-cost option.<br>
                
               DECOR: Go for big white tents, picnic tables covered in plaid tablecloths, checkered blankets, and balloons. And if you want to go really big with your decor, try these 35 summer decor ideas.<br>
                
                FOOD: Don’t overthink it: Serve burgers, hot dogs, potato salad, corn on the cob — you get the idea.<br>
                
                BEVERAGES: On a hot summer day, you can keep it simple with cold beer and lemonade. For something a bit fancier, mix up a cold cocktail like mint juleps.<br>
                
                ACTIVITIES: Set up simple outdoor games such as croquet, badminton, or cornhole. You can even do company Olympics by having team compete in traditional field-day games like dodgeball or relay races.</p>

     For holiday parties, it’s important to be inclusive — but that can make it a little tricky to choose a theme. Something that highlights the season is simple but effective.<br>
    
    Plus, guests always enjoy dressing up for the season, so you probably don’t need to set a concrete dress code to get everyone to show up in their holiday best. Just get the word out that things will be a little more on the formal end.<br>
    
    FOOD: For a more formal event, go with traditional plated options such as tenderloin, chicken, salmon, or grilled portabellas for a vegetarian option.<br>
    
   BEVERAGES: To play off the season’s flavors, serve hot toddies, cranberry-infused martinis, red wine, and dark winter beers.<br>
    
    ACTIVITIES: Since it’s the end of the year, this is the perfect time to share company holiday video and recap of the year’s wins. After that, a little music and dancing can’t hurt!<br>
    
    DECOR: The decor options are endless: We like the idea of sparkling jewel tones or a white-on-white color palette. Winter classics like poinsettia plants, fireplaces, and cozy blankets will add to the atmosphere. And let’s face it — you should probably include a snowflake or two.<br>

   What’s a better way to celebrate closing out Q1 than by “springing” into Q2? After all, you’re off to a fresh start and nothing says fresh like the spring season. “Spring” is a great theme on its own, but if for a more niche theme, check out these 25 creative spring themes for parties and events.<br>
  
 FOOD: Spring has no shortage of in-season vegetables, so plan on special salads, veggie-packed hoers d’oeuvres, and pasta primavera.<br>
  
  BEVERAGES: Keep things light and fresh! We’re thinking white wine, Moscow mules, and lemonade.<br>
  
  ACTIVITIES: If you’ll be outdoors, take advantage! Plan a picnic, bean bag toss, bocce ball, group hike, or other patio-friendly games.<br>
  
  DECOR: Whatever you do, decorate with bright green topiaries, lots of beautiful flowers, and plenty of pastels. The theme is pretty versatile, so feel free to set a dress code as you see fit.<br>
  
  SETTINGS: You can find a classy outdoor space such as a manicured museum lawn or a local botanic garden, or bring things inside with the option for a patio. <br>
