    <h2>BIRTHDAY SCHEDULE</h2>
    <p>In many parts of the world an individual's birthday is celebrated by a party where a specially made cake, usually decorated with lettering and the person's age, is presented. The cake is traditionally studded with the same number of lit candles as the age of the individual, or a number candle representing their age. The celebrated individual will usually make a silent wish and attempt to blow out the candles in one breath; if successful, a tradition holds that the wish will be granted. In many cultures, the wish must be kept secret or it won't "come true". Presents are bestowed on the individual by the guests appropriate to their age. Other birthday activities may include entertainment (sometimes by a hired professional, i.e. a clown, magician, or musician), and a special toast or speech by the birthday celebrant. The last stanza of Patty Hill's and Mildred Hill's famous song, "Good Morning to You" (unofficially titled "Happy Birthday to You") is typically sung by the guests at some point in the proceedings. In some countries a pi√±ata takes the place of a cake.</p>

            <h2>WEDDING SCHEDULE</h2>
            <p>A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers, money, dress), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry, prayers, or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as well as superstitious customs originating in Ancient Rome.</p>

                    <h2>SOCIAL EVENTS SCHEDULE</h2>
                    <p>A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host for the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, or as part of a festival or other commemoration or celebration of a special occasion. A party will typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing or other forms of entertainment. In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer, wine, or distilled spirits.

                        More occasionally (though often in politics), a party can also simply refer to a group of people with a common objective.</p>

                            <p>A corporate meeting generally has the following characteristics: it is not organised by an external organisation; the aim of the meeting is governed by the realisation of business and not mainly by the transmission of knowledge ; the number of companies represented is normally small, whether intra-firm (one single company) or inter-firm (two or more companies); interaction between participants is either non-competitive (no competition, since they belong to the same group), or the competition (if there are tensions within the group) is regulated in an oligopolistic manner (few enterprises are present).</p>
